# Autograder Reminder

Rajiv Bharadwaj - February 2020  

This project is a chrome web extension which will help a lot of students like me to make sure our code works on the UMich CAEN computers before submitting to the autograders.  
This usually happens because the compilers in the autograder are much less forgiving and the CAEN computers also run with the same configuration.
